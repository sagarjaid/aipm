At this point, we don't have the UID available, so FirstPromoter doesn't receive the 'uid' when it's triggered. Also, as you can see in the screenshot, this event is delivered twice by Stripe itself, which could be causing the duplicated lead issue ‚Äî something we can't handle from our end.\n\n[Screenshot]\n\nMy question is: **do we actually need FirstPromoter to be connected to Stripe?** I'm not sure why this integration was set up, but it's causing problems in this case.\n\nFrom our code, we're assigning leads to FirstPromoter only after the checkout session is completed ‚Äî when we do have the UID ‚Äî which seems to be the correct and controlled point for that logic.`,
